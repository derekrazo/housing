[free software licenses](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/) like the GPL, AGPL, LGPL, and GFDL are most aligned with our ideology.
 - GPL for non-networked programs
 - AGPL for networked apps
 - LGPL for libraries
 - GFDL for documentation

a possible idea is to have a contributor license agreement that provides joint ownership to our business in case we ever wanted to change licenses to another free or open source license.
